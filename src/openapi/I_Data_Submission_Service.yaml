    This interface provides access to the **Data Submission Service** of a health record system.
    
    **General conditions**:</br> 
    For all operations if applicable:
    - a section _Client_ in operation descriptions covers recommendations (informative) for clients.
    - a section _Provider_ in operation descriptions covers requirements for the server side. 
    - error responses may be extended by helpful information about the error condition in _errorDetail_

    **Prerequisites**:</br>
    Operations of this interface mandate a mutual authenticated VAU-channel between health record system 
    and a client based on an identity C.FD.AUT with role oid_epa_fdz (the research data center FDZ).
    
    **Retry interval**:</br>
    The following retry interval is suggested in case of an error response:<br>
    - '500' Internal Error
      - approx. 10 minutes

  description: | 
   The Data Submission Service provides pseudonymized medical data and consent decision information regarding the 
   permitted purposes of use of this data (in accordance with SGB V ยง303) for download by the Research Data Center (FDZ).
   
   The provided data originates from several health records hosted by the health record system. Any time new data which
   meets the criterias for data submission is applied to a health record, this data also gets collected 
   and prepared for submission by the data submission service to the FDZ.

   ##### Data accepted for submission
   1. medical data (fhir resources) which are released for pseudonymiszation
   2. changed consents regarding data usage purposes
   3. changed general consent regarding data submission at all (withdrawal of consent, this will also stop any data 
   submission from this particular health record until renewal of consent)   
   
   Amounts of collected data are prepared in packages ("Datenpakete FDZ", as ndjson files) for download by the research data 
   center (FDZ), called submissions. Any particular submission transfers a single package (file) and has its own and unique 
   submissionId for identification.

   Each of the pseudonymous data contained in a submission package is equipped with a working number ("Arbeitsnummer" AN 
   or "job-number-identifier") for delivery.

   The delivery pseudonyms, the working numbers and the submissionId all result from a delivery of the data submission service 
   to the trust office ("Vertrauensstelle" VST). This delivery also announces the submission download link (i.e. a complete 
   address) for the subsequent download of the data package by the FDZ.

   The preparation of data, number generation and VST notification all is defined in detail in:</br>
   - gematik: gemspec_Aktensystem_ePAfueralle, chapter "Data Submission Service" (https://gemspec.gematik.de/releases/)
   - RKI (Robert Koch Institut): Vertrauensstelle Elektronische Patientenakte - Pseudonymisierungskonzept zur Datenausleitung ePA zu Forschungszwecken, Version 2.0 2024-07-12 (no available online)

   ### The download package file:
   The getSubmissionPackage operation always provides a single file for download.

   The file name is defined as "Datenausleitung-AS-FDZ-submissionId.ndjson". The format is newline delimited json
   with a single resource per newline. The resources itself therefor shall not contain any newline statement.

   Each of the contained resources has a working number (job-number-identification) applied. The resources shall appear
   in an ordered sequence within the file, sorted in ascending or descending order related to the working number value.
   The ordering shall disguise the order of data input to the Data Submission Service.

   The file typically and preferrable contains data of several insurants/ health records.

   The file may also contain information about withdrawal of the general consent regarding data submission 
   (consent decision for function "data-submission" of class "secondaryData" set to "deny")."
   
   The file may also contain information about the permitted or denied usage purposes as decided by an insurant. If contained,
   all purposes (the whole set of purposes) shall be included.

   The consent related resources shall only apply in a submission in case of changes to the consent decisions. 
   Purpose consents shall be included (whole set) even if only a single decision for a purpose has changed. 

   If a withdrawal of the general consent for data submission is included, no further purpose consent or 
   medical data resources for the releated insurant (health record) shall be part of the submission file.


   #### Structure of package file:
   (the following example uses newlines for illustration only, the ndjson compatible example will not have any newline 
   (unescaped "\n" character) between the '-- newline --' separators. The separators itself and empty lines shall 
   also not appear in a final file)."
  
   Example submission including one pseudonymized medical data resource, two consent purpose resources 
   and one general consent withdrawel resource in descending order.

   #### Schema for additional resources:
   Fhir medical resources are formatted according to their structure definitions for privacy enhanded resources.

   The consent decision and the purposes are submitted according to structures similar
   to formats used by the consent decision management operations. Both are wrapped in a "fhir-resource style" json
   definition to apply a similar structure as used for real fhir resources, unifying the access to the working
   numbers of data submission content in a file.

        Retrieve a single file containing all data for a particular submission addressed by _submissionId_.</br>
        This operation is limited to users of role oid_epa_fdz.


        **Client:**</br>
        The client is always the research data center ("Forschungsdatenzentrum Gesundheit", FDZ). The client 
        should invoke the file download immediately after receiption of a new _submissionId_ (resp. a download link) 
        from the trust office (VST).
        
        **Provider:**</br>
        The file associated to _submissionId_ shall be returned. The file shall always be named
        "Datenausleitung-AS-FDZ-**submissionId**.ndjson" and contain only data in newline delimited 
        json format.

        The file associated to _submissionId_ shall be deleted without remains after
        - a successful delivery of the data (i.e. succesful download of file), or
        - 72 hours waiting time (i.e. without any attempt to donwload)

        The path parameter _submissionId_ shall be valid as soon as the associated file is prepared for 
        a download and before sending the submission information (including the download link) to the VST).
        The path parameter _submissionId_ shall be invalid as soon as the file is deleted.

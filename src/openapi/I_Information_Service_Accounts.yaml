    This interface provides operations for a health record relocation among different Electronic Health Record System providers.<br/>

    **General conditions**:</br> 
    For all operations if applicable:
    - a section _Client_ in operation descriptions covers recommendations (informative) for clients.
    - a section _Provider_ in operation descriptions covers requirements for the server side. 

    **Prerequisites**:</br>
    This interface does not require a VAU channel/ user session or entitlements but a mutual 
    TLS connection instead.

    **Retry interval**:</br>
    Operation responses '409' Conflict and '500' Internal Error indicate temporary states.
    A retry may apply after a suitable period of waiting time.

       Check wheter a certain KVNR is known among the insurances of a a health record provider and get 
       the consent decision regarding principle usage of a personal health record.

       **Client**:</br>
       A client (a health record system) shall always and only invoke this operation when a new health 
       record is or shall be created on client side (state == UNKNOWN or INITIALIZED) to retrieve the 
       information about a general objection of the insurant against the provision of a personal Health 
       record.
       This operation shall be used prior invocation of _startRelocation_, i.e. _startRelocation_ shall 
       only be used in case _generalConsent_ is set to _true_.

       **Provider**:</br>
       Indicates in the response the state and timestamp of the consent decision regarding the principle usage of 
       a personal health record associated to a particular insurant (kvnr).
       The operation should be independent of the presence of a health record associated to 
       the kvnr (_insurantid_).

       _Information Service Account_ path _/accounts/v1/exportpackagegeneration/{requestid}_
       to enable reception of notifications about the request.

       The provider shall reject the request if the health record has a pending migration from an epa-2.x health record.

       Notify an export package provider about problems receiving or migrating the package.</br>

       **Client**:</br>
       A client shall always invoke this operation when export package download
       and data migration was not successful, not possible or no longer required. 
        
       **Provider**:</br>
       The information shall be passed to the responsible actors (insurance company associated to provider) 
       by proprietary means to allow suitable reactions required by the actor.

       Incidents shall cause the following behaviour:
       - relocationAborted: 
         - The migration and the export package is no longer required for any requesting provider's reason. The 
        request shall be deleted and the health record shall be set to state ACTIVATED again. A requesting
        provider will issue a complete new request on demand in the future.
       - importFailed:
         - the download of a prepared export package was not possible, not complete or not able to be decrypted.
        The export package provider shall solve the problem and prepare a corrected package version. The 
        requesting provider shall be notified about the new package via _putDownloadUrlForExportPackage_. 
        If correction is time consuming, the request may be deleted
        and health record is set back to ACTIVATED. The requesting provider shall be notified about this case
        by a _postPackageDeliveryIncident_ operation call.
       - packageCorrupt:
         - the package content was not understood, of wrong structure or malformed. A corrected package
        shall be deployed as for incident _importFailed_. 
       - urlNotReceived
         - The export package generation is successfully started but download url has not been received yet. 
         Download-url shall be posted immediately or transfer shall be aborted,
         including notification by a _postPackageDeliveryIncident_ operation call.

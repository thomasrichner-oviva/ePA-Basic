  description: |-
    This interface provides access to the service **Consent Decision Management** of the Electronic Health Record system for insurants, representatives and ombuds offices.<br/>
    
    **General conditions**:</br> 
    For all operations if applicable:
    - a section _Client_ in operation descriptions covers recommendations (informative) for clients.
    - a section _Provider_ in operation descriptions covers requirements for the server side. 
    - error responses may be extended by helpful information about the error condition in _errorDetail_

    **Prerequisites**:</br>
    The Health Record System shall provide 
    - name
    - role ((profession-)oid)
    - identifier (telematik-id or KVNR)
    - indication of a valid entitlement
    
    of the current user (requestor) for evaluation in operations.

    Operations mandating a valid entitlement implicitly mandate use of a VAU channel
    and a valid ID-Token. If one of these conditions is not met, the response
    of the (aborted) operation shall always be '403': 'notEntitled'. 

    **Retry interval**:</br>
    The following retry intervals are suggested in case of an error response:<br>
    - '409' Conflict.
      - approx. 24 hours
    - '500' Internal Error
      - approx. 10 minutes

    **User Agent**:</br>
    The user agent information (x-useragent) is part of any request, even if 
    not essentially required for the operation (e.g. raw-data collection), and
    may be considered for provider internal use. 

    **Log-Entries**
    Whenever a _Postcondition_ mandates a log-entry, this entry shall contain
    data as defined in A_24055*.

     Consent decision management provides operations to manage the insurant's consent decisions regarding the 
     detailed purposes of use of transmitted health record data in the research data center (FDZ).    
  - name: UdpMedication
    description: |
      UdpMedication allows configuration of the user specific deny policy for medication service only. 
      The UdpMedication is managed for a health record by setting or deleting assignments by the insurant 
      or an entitled representative.</br>
      An assignment is related to a single user identified by a telematik-id. Any user covered by 
      an assignment is excluded from access to the medication service, i.e. each operation of the medication 
      service invoked by this user is aborted and leads to an error.
      
      **Allowed usergroups for UdpMedication assigments:**:</br> 
      TheUdpMedication shall have entries for users of the following roles (professionOid) only.</br>

        Update the user decision regarding a particular consent related function of a 
        personal health record.</br>
        This operation is limited to entitled users of role oid_versicherter and oid_ombudsstelle.

        **Client**:</br>
        no recommendations.

        **Provider**:</br>
        A changed consent decision shall be persisted securely in SecureDataStorage and become 
        immediately valid.

        Changed consents of class "healthCareProcess" shall also be made available for the Information Service.

        _functionid_ == _medication_:</br> 
        The change of this decision alters the medication process participation and shall cause special impact 
        for the XDS document service and the Fhir data service. If set to _deny_, no client (any oid) - except 
        the ePrescription backend, the insurant and representatives (oid_erp-vau, oid_versicherter) - shall be 
        able to read or write medication related data (locked). 
        Vice versa these clients are unlocked for intented use if decision is set to _permit_. </br>        
          - (a) lock the following data categories if _functionid_ = _medication_ is 
            set to _deny_: 
            - xds data category "emp"; folder.Codelist: code = "emp"; codeSystem = "urn:oid:1.2.276.0.76.5.512"
            - fhir data service "medication"
          - (b) unlock the following data categories if _functionid_ = _medication_ is 
            set to _permit_: 
            - xds data category "emp"; folder.Codelist: code = "emp"; codeSystem = "urn:oid:1.2.276.0.76.5.512"
            - fhir data service "medication"
          - (h) set the decision for _erp-submission_ to _permit_ if _functionid_ = _medication_ is 
            set to _permit_.

        _functionid_ == _erp-submission_:</br> 
        The change of this decision shall cause special impact for the XDS document service and the Fhir data service
        and disable the data collection related to the medication process if set to _deny_. 
        A decision change also sets the corresponding decision for _medication_ implicitly.</br> 
          - (c) remove all data from following data category (folder/service) if _functionid_ = _erp-submission_ is 
            set to _deny_:
            - xds data category "emp"; folder.Codelist: code = "emp"; codeSystem = "urn:oid:1.2.276.0.76.5.512"
            - fhir data service "medication"
          - (d) lock all operations for the ePrescription backend (oid_erp-vau) if _functionid_ = _erp-submission_ is 
            set to _deny_.
          - (e) unlock all operations for the ePrescription backend (oid_erp-vau) if _functionid_ = _erp-submission_ is 
            set to _permit_.
          - (f) set the decision for _medication_ to _deny_ (including the consequences for clients) if _functionid_ = _erp-submission_ is 
            set to _deny_.

        _functionid_ == _data-submission_:</br> 
          The change of this decision prevents submission of pseudonymized medical data to the research data center (FDZ) if set to _deny_. 
          The _deny_-decision information shall be sent to the FDZ instead of any further data for secondary usage.
          If set to _permit_ new medical data will be pseudonymized and send to the FDZ, including the consent decisions 
          of data usage purpose of the insurant.</br> 
        
        If decision provided equals decision stored (i.e. no change), this shall not cause an error response.

        An unknown parameter _functionid_ shall lead to rejection of the request. This operation operates on existings
        resources only and does not create new ones.

        An email shall be sent to the insurant using the registered mail address after a successful change of 
        a decision for notification. The mail shall contain understandable information about the changed consent
        decision(s) and timestamp of change (according to A_24844*)."

        The response of a successful operation shall contain all changed consent decisions.
